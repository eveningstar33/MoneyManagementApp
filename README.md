# MoneyManagementApp
Budget app for money management written on Vanilla Javascript.

This app allows us to add incomes and expenses for a certain month. It calculates how much money we have made and how much
we spent and then it gives us a nice budget.

If you want to remove an item from the list, you can simply click on the icons that appears when you hover over them and 
then it disappears and the budget is immediately updated. 

The app also calculates the percentage that each of these expenses is of the total income.
